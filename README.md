## Hi, Iâ€™m @pushpenderpannu
I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in cloud architecture, data analysis, and DevOps, currently serving as a Manager at Accenture. My expertise spans across GCP, AWS, and Azure cloud platforms, specializing in streaming solutions, data pipeline development with Python, and Kafka architecture (including Confluent Kafka setup and Kafka Streams).

I have a strong background in integrating diverse systems and developing robust data loading and ingestion pipelines. My experience includes leading significant infrastructure migration projects and building self-service DevOps portals. I am proficient in technologies like Spring Boot, Java, Angular, JavaScript, SQL, and Unix scripting.

In my previous roles at IBM, I gained considerable experience in middleware administration (WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere MQ, IIB Integration Bus), Sterling OMS module development, and setting up deployment processes. I am passionate about optimizing development workflows and implementing scalable, efficient solutions.

My GitHub profile will showcase projects and contributions related to:
Cloud Architecture: Demonstrating expertise in GCP, AWS, and Azure, particularly in streaming data solutions.
Data Engineering: Examples of Python-based data loading and ingestion pipelines, and Kafka-related implementations.
DevOps: Projects highlighting automated pipelines (Jenkins), self-service portals (Angular), and infrastructure monitoring scripts.
API Management: Work with CA API Gateway and Azure API Gateway, including OAuth configurations and policy design.
Spring Boot & Java: Applications built with Spring Boot, especially those involving Kafka and database integrations
